    Package Declaration: This code is part of a Java package named src.main.java.
     Packages are used to organize classes into namespaces.

    Imports: These lines import necessary Java classes and interfaces used in the
    program. They include classes for file I/O (BufferedReader, FileReader),
    exceptions (IOException), and data structures (HashMap).

    Class Declaration: The WordForWord class contains methods for processing text
    files. It includes methods for loading a file, counting characters, words, and
     lines, and calculating word and letter frequencies.

    Instance Variables:
        fileContent: Stores the content of the loaded file.
        wcResult: Stores the result of word count operation.
        wordFrequencyMap: Stores the frequency of words in the file content.
        letterFrequencyMap: Stores the frequency of letters in the file content.

    Main Method: This is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of
     the WordForWord class, loads a file, processes its content, and prints a report.

    Load File Method (loadFile): This method reads the contents of a file line by line
     using a BufferedReader, and stores the content as a single string in the fileContent
      variable.

    Process All Method (processAll): This method executes all text processing operations
     on the loaded file content. It calls three other methods: wc, wordFrequency, and
     letterFrequency, and stores the results in respective variables.

    To String Method (toString): This method generates a report summarizing the results of
    the text processing operations. It includes statistics such as character count, word count,
     line count, word frequency, and letter frequency.

    Text Processing Methods:
        wc: Counts the number of characters, words, and lines in the input string and returns
         the counts as a WCResult object.
        wordFrequency: Counts the frequency of each word in the input string and returns the
        counts as a FrequencyMap.
        letterFrequency: Counts the frequency of each letter in the input string and returns
         the counts as a FrequencyMap.

    WCResult Class: This class is a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) that represents the result of
    the word count operation. It contains three fields: charCount, wordCount, and lineCount,
     along with getter methods.

    FrequencyMap Class: This class extends HashMap<String, Long> and represents a map of
    frequencies for words or letters. It provides a custom method increment to increment the
     count for a given key.
